<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the 30sites in 30 days challenge. I completed day one of that which featured doing a portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Sort of struggled with CSS and bootstrap nav bar. UI is still ways off for me in terms of color selection and all that

### Day2: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Been a few days since I have logged here. Loads of challenges like electricity and data. But No excuses.
Did loads of work on my projects. I built a site to house my sites from the 30 days challenge. Worked on the layout for my Weather App. Did part of the javascript functionality - getting my user's location via the geolocation api

**Thoughts:** I struggle with motivation and resistance.
I need to dedicate to being a pro not an amateur and fastrack my learning curve. My css is improving greatly and I now Know the importance of debugging code, for instance using the chrome dev tools.

## Day3: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have been away from this log for a bit. I worked on and rounded off my Weather App. I have since pushed it to github and codepen and have begun work on the layout of the views of my Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts**: Understanding javascript scopes and closures still evades me a bit. I managed to pull of the project with the weather app. My jquery is improving and I made use of a lot of jquery functionality such as .html(), .text() etc.

## Day4: July 29, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have been consistently coding over an hour each day. Been working on the logic of the wikipedia viewer. So far so good, I have the layout just as I want it. I used bootstrap and jquery. Today I finalized parsing the data i got from the '$.JSON' request sent to the wikipedia api.

**Thoughts**: I am making steady progress as long as I keep working at it. My javascript is improving in bits. However I struggle with displaying the results from my api request on my page. I will take some time to think about this on paper

## Day 5: July 30, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have finally rounded off with the 'mini-wiki' app. That's what I call the app I made for the 'wikipedia viewer' freecodecamp zipline. I polished the user experience by making the search box focused on page load. Then styled my result page and added a 'random article' button and a 'home' button on the results page.

**Thoughts**: I have been having trouble pushing my work to github due to poor internet connections. It seems to always break midway. Anyways I did upload it to codepen.

# New sprint

Being self taught requires a ton of discipline and proper use of available resources.
I had previously failed to maintain this log of my coding activities, even though I had really been coding away for quite a while in-between the last log and this.

In the span of time between my last log and now. I had gone on to complete a 3-month remote internship. Polished my javascript and a few other things. 

I am listing my goals for now and the mid term here to serve as a motivation when I go through this log and also to keep me focused on what I need to do and where I need to be:
1. Learn React
2. Design my Portfolio site and personal blog theme on figma
3. Use this design to create a jekyll site to host on github
4. Get freecodecamps front end Development certification
5. Finish a job ready guide.
6. Get freecodecamps back end Development certification
7. complete 20 Project Euler challenges
8. Complete 20 hackerrank challenges

These are a bit of my short-mid term goals, and this challenge will help me stay on track.
## Day 6: December 10, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have been previously away from here as I mentioned above. I worked on my portfolio site and added a carousel to it.

**Thoughts**: I had to look up a tutorial on pure css carousel, since all the components on my site are hand made responsive with no frame works. I made this decision as a way of levelling up my front end skills and efficiency. Sass helps me manage my styles too.

## Day 7: December 11, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Today's sprint was focused... I worked on translating my portfolio design to a responsive one page site. Today was me doing the media queries to support larger screen sizes. 

**Thoughts**: Wow, I did learn a bit more about responsive design. Plus I made use of the 'unset' value at a point in time. The scenario was that on my main style sheet i had something absolutely positioned with ```top: 0```, and i had to , in my media query cancel out this top value so as to set it to ```right: 40px```. The solution was as simple as ```top: unset```. That did the trick.

## Day 8: December 12, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Today I was on limited internet connectivity so i decided to do a little levelling up with wes bos' javascript 30 course. I did the array cardio workout

**Thoughts**: I was a little bit comfortable with certain array methods before now, viz map, reduce, filter, sort... However i did glean some insight into the sort and reduce method as to how powerful they can be. A sort method can sort anything, even using properties of objects in the array as criteria. The reduce method provides a lot of flexibility for manipulating arrays as well

## Day 9-11: December 13-15, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Limited power has made my projects suffer. Had to switch to watching video tutorials i had previously downloaded, viz Kyle simpsons JS courses and CS50. I also worked on CS50 problem sets for week one.

**Thoughts**: I need to focus on focusing on my time... not the best grammer but that accurately describes my situation.

## Day 12: December 16, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a few freecodecamp backend way points, viz getting started with node. The lessons were basically from nodeschools workshops.

**Thoughts**: I seem to be getting more confident in my version of solutions to challenges rather than just copy-pasta of what the walkthrough suggests.

## Day 13: December 17, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Finished freecodecamp's intermediate algorithm scripting section. Yayness!!!.

**Thoughts**: Wow, makeing a ton of progress, whats between me and my goal of FCC frontend certification is just 3 projects...

## Day 14: December 18, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Continued with react course from "Road to learn React"

**Thoughts**: React is awesome, and as I take the tutorial I envisage several scenarios in which I can make us of its APIs. Also I am awed by conditional rendering in react and JSX in particular. Apparently you can't make use of if statements in your JSX for this so ternary operator is more suitable. It is also explicit in my opinion and aids readability;

**Link to today's work**:
1. [if-else in JSX](https://react-cn.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html)
my work today is local. The link above highlights how to do conditional rendering within the render() method's return statement;

## Day 15: December 19, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Poor connectivity affected my workflow. Couldn't do much online. Had to resort to watching videos from Udacity about "offline first".

**Thoughts**: Also read a few inspiring articles about my craft and its potential. I just need to keep coding daily and building the mental muscle.

**Link to today's work**:
1. [Awesome article](goo.gl/EgxP7c)

## Day 16-19: December 20-23, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with "Road to Learn React"

**Thoughts**: Debugging skills need a bit more uping, struggled with on tiny bug that won't allow my search form prevent reloading using `event.preventDefault()`

**Link to today's work**:

## Day 20-21: December 24-26, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Worked on and finished a responsive web design challenge. Awesome stuff. Took a break on Christmas day though.

**Thoughts**: Wow, learned a lot, made use of Css grids and flexbox. Flexed my positioning muscles a bit.

## Day 22: December 27, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the ALC Udacity web course. Actually finished the first part on responsive web design.

**Thoughts**: I think its a whole growth process. I have been slacking in recent times, partly due to me trying to overwhelm myself with a lot at the same time.

## Day 23: December 28, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Limited power :/ , had to watch CS50 videos on mobile. Sorta as a form of taking a break.

**Thoughts**: Understood a bit more about command line arguments. Gave me a bit more insight into the process.argv[] array of a node command. argv - for argument vector which is an array of commands supplied with the program.

## Day 24: December 29, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the CS50 course and did some problem sets. namely a caesar's cipher albeit in C language!

**Thoughts**: Javascript makes life plain easy. I mean lots of data manipulation are very seamless in javascript compared to C. In C just converting a string to an int requires you to #include the library function that holds that particular method. yuck! But it got me thinking and 'sweating' too :)

## Day 25: December 30, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the JavaScript Calculator, from FCC's waypoint.

**Thoughts**: Pair coding helps a programmer think broadly. Also working swiftly through a problem set when you are refreshed gives you quite a bit of momentum. I also liked how I tackled each feature one at a time.

## Day 26: December 31, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the JavaScript Calculator, from FCC's waypoint.

**Thoughts**: Added code for several functionality of the calculator, and its amazing how I tend to put things away when I think they are challenging, rather than face them squarely. Anyways, tomorrow is a new year

## Day 27: January, 1st 2018 ##

**Today's Progress**: Finished work on the JavaScript Calculator, from FCC's waypoint.

**Thoughts**: Pair programming is definitely awesome!!!. If that is unavailable, talking to an imaginary colleague while working might suffice. Whatever you want to put into code, make sure you simplify the workings in various steps of pseudocode, it'll help ensure you understand what code you are required to write

## Day 28: January, 2nd 2018 ##

**Today's Progress**: Finished problem set2  on CS50 course;

**Thoughts**: Thinking through a problem algorithmically in byte sized steps is very valuable, it helps highlight the flaws (if any) in your thought process.
