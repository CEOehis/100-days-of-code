### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the 30sites in 30 days challenge. I completed day one of that which featured doing a portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Sort of struggled with CSS and bootstrap nav bar. UI is still ways off for me in terms of color selection and all that

### Day2: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Been a few days since I have logged here. Loads of challenges like electricity and data. But No excuses.
Did loads of work on my projects. I built a site to house my sites from the 30 days challenge. Worked on the layout for my Weather App. Did part of the javascript functionality - getting my user's location via the geolocation api

**Thoughts:** I struggle with motivation and resistance.
I need to dedicate to being a pro not an amateur and fastrack my learning curve. My css is improving greatly and I now Know the importance of debugging code, for instance using the chrome dev tools.

## Day3: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have been away from this log for a bit. I worked on and rounded off my Weather App. I have since pushed it to github and codepen and have begun work on the layout of the views of my Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts**: Understanding javascript scopes and closures still evades me a bit. I managed to pull of the project with the weather app. My jquery is improving and I made use of a lot of jquery functionality such as .html(), .text() etc.
