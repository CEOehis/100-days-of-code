<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the 30sites in 30 days challenge. I completed day one of that which featured doing a portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Sort of struggled with CSS and bootstrap nav bar. UI is still ways off for me in terms of color selection and all that

### Day2: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Been a few days since I have logged here. Loads of challenges like electricity and data. But No excuses.
Did loads of work on my projects. I built a site to house my sites from the 30 days challenge. Worked on the layout for my Weather App. Did part of the javascript functionality - getting my user's location via the geolocation api

**Thoughts:** I struggle with motivation and resistance.
I need to dedicate to being a pro not an amateur and fastrack my learning curve. My css is improving greatly and I now Know the importance of debugging code, for instance using the chrome dev tools.

## Day3: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have been away from this log for a bit. I worked on and rounded off my Weather App. I have since pushed it to github and codepen and have begun work on the layout of the views of my Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts**: Understanding javascript scopes and closures still evades me a bit. I managed to pull of the project with the weather app. My jquery is improving and I made use of a lot of jquery functionality such as .html(), .text() etc.

## Day4: July 29, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have been consistently coding over an hour each day. Been working on the logic of the wikipedia viewer. So far so good, I have the layout just as I want it. I used bootstrap and jquery. Today I finalized parsing the data i got from the '$.JSON' request sent to the wikipedia api.

**Thoughts**: I am making steady progress as long as I keep working at it. My javascript is improving in bits. However I struggle with displaying the results from my api request on my page. I will take some time to think about this on paper

## Day 5: July 30, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have finally rounded off with the 'mini-wiki' app. That's what I call the app I made for the 'wikipedia viewer' freecodecamp zipline. I polished the user experience by making the search box focused on page load. Then styled my result page and added a 'random article' button and a 'home' button on the results page.

**Thoughts**: I have been having trouble pushing my work to github due to poor internet connections. It seems to always break midway. Anyways I did upload it to codepen.

====================================================================
# New sprint

Being self taught requires a ton of discipline and proper use of available resources.
I had previously failed to maintain this log of my coding activities, even though I had really been coding away for quite a while in-between the last log and this.

In the span of time between my last log and now. I had gone on to complete a 3-month remote internship. Polished my javascript and a few other things. 

I am listing my goals for now and the mid term here to serve as a motivation when I go through this log and also to keep me focused on what I need to do and where I need to be:
1. Learn React
2. Design my Portfolio site and personal blog theme on figma
3. Use this design to create a jekyll site to host on github
4. Get freecodecamps front end Development certification
5. Finish a job ready guide.
6. Get freecodecamps back end Development certification
7. complete 20 Project Euler challenges
8. Complete 20 hackerrank challenges

These are a bit of my short-mid term goals, and this challenge will help me stay on track.
## Day 6: December 10, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: I have been previously away from here as I mentioned above. I worked on my portfolio site and added a carousel to it.

**Thoughts**: I had to look up a tutorial on pure css carousel, since all the components on my site are hand made responsive with no frame works. I made this decision as a way of levelling up my front end skills and efficiency. Sass helps me manage my styles too.

## Day 7: December 11, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Today's sprint was focused... I worked on translating my portfolio design to a responsive one page site. Today was me doing the media queries to support larger screen sizes. 

**Thoughts**: Wow, I did learn a bit more about responsive design. Plus I made use of the 'unset' value at a point in time. The scenario was that on my main style sheet i had something absolutely positioned with ```top: 0```, and i had to , in my media query cancel out this top value so as to set it to ```right: 40px```. The solution was as simple as ```top: unset```. That did the trick.

## Day 8: December 12, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Today I was on limited internet connectivity so i decided to do a little levelling up with wes bos' javascript 30 course. I did the array cardio workout

**Thoughts**: I was a little bit comfortable with certain array methods before now, viz map, reduce, filter, sort... However i did glean some insight into the sort and reduce method as to how powerful they can be. A sort method can sort anything, even using properties of objects in the array as criteria. The reduce method provides a lot of flexibility for manipulating arrays as well

## Day 9-11: December 13-15, 2017 ##

**Today's Progress**: Limited power has made my projects suffer. Had to switch to watching video tutorials i had previously downloaded, viz Kyle simpsons JS courses and CS50. I also worked on CS50 problem sets for week one.

**Thoughts**: I need to focus on focusing on my time... not the best grammer but that accurately describes my situation.
